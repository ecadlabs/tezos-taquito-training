# README

This directory contains source files and compiled artifacts (conveniently) for Tezos development.

Depending on the workshop you follow, you might use only the compiled artifacts.

# Parameter,Storage List

* When you compile with `ligo`, it auto-creates both `<contract>.{parameter,storage}List.mligo` for you
* These files can be used to selectively test and run the contracts for convenience

# Ideas

* Extend the contract interface with a facility to keep high score by address
