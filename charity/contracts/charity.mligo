(*
  This Tezos CameLIGO Smart Contract implements functionality that would allow a charity or
  non-profit foundation to raise / receive funds in the form of Tez.

  An organization sets up their receiving address by calling new_charity, which takes as parameters
  the name of the organization and a wallet address into which they can receive funds.

  Extension: A Charity may "Pause" their wallet_address, during which donations cannot be taken.

  IDEAS:
    * Implement `Pause` functionality
    * List charities functionality (as a View)
    * Sum donations across all charities ("total donations")
    * Refactor new_charity to take Option(address) and use Sender if None
