(*
  This Tezos CameLIGO Smart Contract implements functionality that would allow a charity or
  non-profit foundation to raise / receive funds in the form of Tez.

  An organization sets up their receiving address by creating a new instance of the Charity
  contract, which takes as parameters the name of the organization and their wallet address and
  returns the address of the newly-created contract.

  Glossary of Terms:

    Charity: The organization that wishes to receive funds
    Paused: Whether or not the contract is currently active (true or false)

  TODO:
    * Paused functionality
    * List charities functionality

  IDEAS:
    * Refactor new_charity to take Option(address) and use Sender if None
